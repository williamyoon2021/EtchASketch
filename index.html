              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                As part of our ECE 5725 final project, we created a digital Etch-A-Sketch simulator. This simulator is capable of 
                drawing with precision using rotary encoders that control left-to-right and top-to-bottom movement. Additionally, 
                the user is able to interact further by shaking an accelerometer to delete the current image, much like the original toy. 
                Finally, there is a primarily digital feature that allows drawings to be saved and reloaded for future use.

          <h2>Project Objective:</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Enable precise drawing control using rotary encoders, as similar to an etch-a-sketch as possible.</li>
              <li>Incorporate shake to erase functionality via the accelerometer.</li>

          </div>
      </div>

    <hr id='design'>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <h2>Software Design</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">To implement our Etch-A-Sketch functionality in software, we used an incremental design process. We started by implementing the drawing feature in PyGame, using keys on a keyboard as input. In the following weeks, we added color, saving/loading images, and resetting the image. By getting the functionality working on a laptop before trying to integrate it into our Raspberry Pi system, we were able to start working on our project while waiting to receive the rotary encoders and the accelerometer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">To support saving and loading drawings, we saved the screen surface that contains all the rendered pixels into a bitmap (.bmp) file. We embedded the timestamp of the drawing and the state of the drawing element into the filename, so we could easily also store metadata about the drawings without having to create a separate metadata store that introduces potential for errors relating to metadata being out of sync with the stored images. By prefixing the filename with the timestamp, we could also easily chronologically sort the drawings for cycling through our save history.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">When we began integration of our new hardware into the Etch-A-Sketch program, we abstracted out functions for each feature and added sections of code that would only run on the Raspberry Pi. For the accelerometer, it uses a helpful library called <code>adafruit_lis3dh</code> to handle reading the signals. We ran into some stability issues with the accelerometer randomly disconnecting and causing OS errors when we tried to initialize the module in our code; however, this was fixed by adding a delay during setup. The accelerometer reading gives us values for acceleration in the x, y, and z directions. We just combined the values using the Pythagorean formula and experimented with values for a threshold to determine if the device was being shaken or not.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The rotary encoders were also straightforward to setup, and we used the GPIO interface already in place for the buttons to read inputs from the rotary encoders. The logic was also relatively simple once we understood the reasoning. 
          For background knowledge, a rotary encoder is a device that detects the degree of rotation and direction of the attached knob. 
          As the knob is turned, each “click” indicates that one positional movement has taken place. These clicks can be tracked by the 
          “CLK” signal to provide either absolute positional data or incremental positional data. To determine direction, we take advantage 
          of the “DT” signal and see how its state changes relative to the CLK signal. Within each iteration of the game loop, the code would check both rotary encoders for a rotation and appropriately move the drawing element around.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">After the basic functionality of moving the drawing element around and clearing the screen was implemented with the rotary encoders and accelerometer, we also added functionality to the buttons on the PiTFT display, using the same GPIO pin approach from prior labs. We decided to have one of the buttons cycle through red, green, blue, and black colors, one of the buttons dedicated to saving the current screen and drawing element location, one of the buttons dedicated to cycling through and loading previously saved drawings, and the final button used to quit the application.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                Similar to past labs, we utilized the Raspberry Pi alongside a piTFT screen, with the intentions of adding additional hardware 
                features that allow user interfacing. To simulate the traditional knob-based controls of Etch-A-Sketch, we decided to use two 
                rotary encoders as knobs.
                <br> <br>
                Since these rotary encoders have built in 10k Ohm resistors, there is no need to add additional pull-up resistors. As a result, 
                we connect the CLK, DT, GND, and 3V3 pins to their respective ports (CLK and DT utilize GPIO ports). This can all be seen in the 
                datasheet provided in the references section. Overall, using rotary encoders over potentiometers was a great decision that saved 
                time and effort. As mentioned before, since the rotary encoders had embedded absolute and relational positional data (based on clicks),
                we did not have to deal with any analog data. Using a potentiometer, we would have to create our own positional ranges based on the 
                variable output voltage. Additionally, rotary encoders have an infinite turning radius, meaning it can be twisted around without being
                mechanically stopped, while potentiometers do not. This hardware design choice allowed us to focus more on the software design. 
                <br> <br>
                To simulate the manual shaking-to-delete process, we decided to use a 1 LIS3DH 3-axis accelerometer. To interface with the Raspberry Pi, 
                we utilized the I2C communication protocol. Although there was no significant difference between using I2C vs. SPI, we chose I2C since less 
                wires were required. Since we are only using one system (Raspberry Pi) and one device (accelerometer), we did not have to consider tradeoffs 
                regarding clock synchronization, device sharing, etc. As a result, we connect the VIN, GND, SDA, SCL, and INT pins to their respective ports 
                (INT utilizes GPIO ports).
                <br> <br>

              <h2>Drawings</h2>
              <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/FINAL.jpeg" alt="Hardware Schematic">
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Here is an overall schematic of our hardware design. All the specific GPIO ports we utilized to 
                connect with the Rotary Encoders and LIS3DH are shown. For ease of understanding, the Raspberry Pi and piTFT is shown as the single "Raspberry Pi"
                box, and with the highlight being the additional hardware.</p>
      </div>

    <hr id='testing'>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Since we were working with multiple different hardware components (rotary encoders, accelerometer), we 
                first wrote throwaway code to figure out how to interface with each component individually through the GPIO pins and tested to make sure it worked.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">After testing components individually, we integrated them into our existing game code that previously used 
                keyboard inputs and began testing the entire system manually. We also tried drawing various shapes to make sure the system felt like it was working correctly, 
                and even tried reproducing some art. Results in that area, however, were not promising.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Our testing strategy actually caught some issues with how we were processing our rotary encoder inputs. A few hours
                 before the demo, we noticed that the rotary encoders had started working very inconsistently. Frequently they would get stuck going in one direction no matter 
                 which way the knob was physically being turned. However, randomly it would start working normally again. We tweaked the length of various sleep calls within our 
                 code to try to fix this issue, and this ultimately seemed to alleviate the inconsistent functionality. However, we later realized that it wasn't changing the values 
                 that fixed our issue, but rather it was that we had existed the SSH connection into the Pi. We believe that the SSH connection was making our latencies within our code 
                 inconsistent due to the use of the modified real-time kernel from Lab 4 on our system.</p>
      </div>

    <hr id='result'>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"> Overall, our team met the goals outlined in the description. We utilized two rotary encoders that controlled up/down and left/right positioning, respectively.
                We were able to shake an accelerometer to completely wipe the screen consistently without having it trigger on accident. We were able to properly save and cycle
                through loaded images, with each image retaining all visual information. However, as mentioned in the Testing section, we ran into a few bugs throughout the project. 
                For one, our accelerometer sometimes had trouble connecting to the Raspberry Pi through I2C, requiring us to constantly replug the wire. Additionally, we ran into several
                unexpected issues during our Demo. The rotary encoder issues were mentioned above, but we also seemed to have forgot to place borders around the edges of the screen. As a result,
                the pixel cursor could be run off the screen. These issues are noted, but they are minor enough where we still feel satisfied with our project's completion.

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Conclusions</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"> By designing and implementing this project from scratch, we felt confident in our abilities to utilize the hardware
                and software capabilities of the Raspberry Pi. Given the limited time span, it was a great experience figuring out how to implement additional hardware on our own.
                Usually the labs handouts assist us with the schematic, so it was rewarding finding datasheets online and deciphering them. On the software side, it felt like a culmination
                of the class as we utilized many ideas we had already learnt. Additionally, it was challenging figuring out how to interact with the additional hardware we utilized. We realized
                that interpolating data is just as difficult as receiving data. We did not run into anything that completely did not work, but as mentioned above, our hardware decision of utilizing
                rotary encoders over potentiometers saved a lot of stress. The potentiometer would definitely not have worked, so it was good that we did not waste any time attempting to use them.

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Future Work</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Given more time, there is a lot of potential to expand the project through software. Since the main hardware aspects
                 of the Etch-A-Sketch are complete, we can take advantage of the digital aspect of our simulation. For example, we could have a feature for automatically playing back
                 saved drawings, having the program recreate the order and color that the pixels were filled in. Perhaps this could be done by associating each saved image with a vector
                 of filled in pixels and have the playback feature iterate through this vector. Additionally, we could look into adding a starting menu that provides an "Options", "New", and "Load" button. 
                 The "Option" button could have the user choose their starting color. The "Load" feature could be linked to the repository containing all the files and have the user choose which drawing to
                 resume. The "New" button would just start a new drawing. These buttons could be interacted through touch-screen to incorporate additional Raspberry Pi capabilities.
